This is my process of creating a facebook messenger bot. I live streamed the entire process on Twitch and Youtube.

I had tons of fun doing this project. I learned a shit ton about the powerful Facebook Graph API. I utilized AWS Lambda which was handy because I can just throw some code into the Cloud 9 IDE and not have to worry about setting up any servers. Other than that it was a pretty basic bot. :)
