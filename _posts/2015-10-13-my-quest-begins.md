The great philosopher Aristotle once said.

> &#8220;For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.&#8221;

I believe in this quote 1000%. There is no better way to learn or get better at a skill than practice, repetition and teaching. This is the goal with my blog.

If you could not already tell by the url, My name is Adrian Eufracio. I am a UI Developer that loves learning. I have noticed my dev skills are not at the level I would like them to be so I decided to create a place where I can write about the things I know in an effort to boost my own knowledge. I am proficient in HTML and CSS but what I am really passionate about is JavaScript. More specifically ES6, Modules, Node.js, React, and code testing, to name a few. My JavaScript skills are sub-par and lately I have been feeling down in the dumps about it. Almost as if JavaScript were the popular girl in school and I was the nerd who had no chance to date her. Well this nerd is going through a makeover.

I know that my skills will improve as I write about what I learn and share with my fellow developers. I want to know the ins and outs of javascript because it is the code of the present and the future. I will also touch on other web development topics. My quest to become a Front-End Ninja starts now.
