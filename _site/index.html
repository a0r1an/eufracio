        </h2>
        <p>When a page initially loads, many requests are made to the browser. Content, Images, and JavaScript Files are just some of the types of requests made to the browser. For websites that require lots of content and images, it is best to delay the requests for these assets until they need to be displayed. Ajax gives developers the tools to do just that.</p>
